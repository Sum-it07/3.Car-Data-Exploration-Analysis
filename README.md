# 3.Car-Data-Exploration-Analysis

This repository contains an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of car data. The analysis is performed using Python and popular data science libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to understand the characteristics of car owners and their vehicles. The dataset contains information about car owners' income, marital status, education, job, car type, car age, and other relevant features. The analysis includes:

- Data cleaning: Correcting data types, removing duplicates, handling missing values, and treating outliers.
- Data transformation: Normalizing and scaling numerical features.
- Data visualization: Creating insightful plots to explore the data and identify patterns.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is named `13. EDA_Cars_Data.xlsx`. It contains 303 rows and 13 columns. A data dictionary is provided in the notebook to explain the meaning of each column.

## Usage

To run the analysis, you need to have Python 3 installed along with the required libraries. You can install them using pip:
bash pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scipy scikit-learn
Then, you can open the Jupyter notebook `Car_Data_Analysis.ipynb` and run the cells to execute the code.

## Results

The analysis reveals interesting insights about the car data, such as:

- The average income of car owners is $50,000.
- Most car owners are married and have a college degree.
- The most popular car type is Sedan.
- There is a positive correlation between income and car age.
